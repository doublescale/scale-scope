- relative camera moving (unproject using view matrices?)
- click-to-focus (query depth under cursor, unproject)
- make key-bindings configurable
- center camera and set distance based on bounding box
- hardcode shaders as a fallback if shaders/ doesn't exist
- factor out view-motion integration (FRP?)
- specular shading, specular maps, bump maps
- multiple objects/textures
- loading screen
- consider using Accelerate for normals and skeletal deform
